Over the past year I've spent a lot of time exploring web performance. What I've 
learned is that there is always a performant solution to a problem and 
less performant solution.  

Sometimes - for whatever reasons - it's not possible to apply the most 
performant solutions to whatever project your working on. This is total bummer
when all you want to do is make things as fast as possible.

I need a project with the ultimate goal of setting the bar when it comes 
to web performance. A project uncoupled from business agendas and legacy code. 
My hope is that this blog can be that project.

Over the next while, I'll be working on transforming this blog from a 
[simple Hugo theme](http://themes.gohugo.io/cocoa/), to a golden example of
web performance. Each iteration will be accompannied by a blog post and will 
focus on a particular problem. 

Wish me luck!
